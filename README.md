# Scripts for CyberPatriot

These are scripts for cyberpatriot written by [Nate Lowinger](https://github.com/ShinyDuck21)

There will be scripts for both windows and linux. Windows Server will get scripts eventually. But for now I am focusing on windows and linux (speciffically ubuntu and forks of ubuntu)
